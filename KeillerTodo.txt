Step 1:
convert geojson into an image with the same size of the input image

Step 2:
extract pixel coordinates from the converted image and create the csv
- can be done using python


1. get image, find top left and bottom right geocoords in it
2. calc all possible geolocation x-y points in the image
3. search general geojson file to find every poss bounding box within the image
4. for all bounding boxes found, save them in a new geojson file for that image
5. convert geocoords from each bounding box to pixel x-y coords
6. save in json file

read it 1 uuid at a time, if they are within image coords, save it to a new geojson file as the uuid object?
